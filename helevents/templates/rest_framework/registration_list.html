        <h2 id="filtering-retrieved-registration">Filtering retrieved registration</h2>
        <p>Query parameters can be used to filter the retrieved registrations by the following criteria.</p>

        <h3 id="event-text">Event text</h3>
        <p>To find out registrations that contain a specific string in any of its event's text
        fields, use the query parameter <code>text</code>.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>registration/?text=shostakovich</code></pre>
        <p><a href="?text=shostakovich" title="json">See the result</a></p>

        <h3 id="event-type">Event type</h4>
        <p>You may use the query parameter <code>event_type</code>, comma separated, to get
        only registrations with event of specific types.
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>registration/?event_type=course</code></pre>
        <p><a href="?event_type=course" title="json">See the result</a></p>
            
        <h3 id="getting-detailed-data">Getting detailed data</h2>
        <p>In the default case, event, keywords, locations, and other fields that
        refer to separate resources are only displayed as simple references.</p>
        <p>If you want to include the complete data from related resources in
        the current response, use the keyword <code>include</code>.</p> 
        <p><strong> Please note, however,
        that including all the resources inlined in *every* event will result in a huge number
        of duplicate data in the json, making the json very slow to generate and process and causing
        considerable API load and long response times when too many such requests are made. Therefore,
        if you are listing the maximum number of events (100) or updating your cache with all events,
        please consider caching the keyword and location data separately to prevent unnecessary API
        slowdown and continuous repeated work. Keyword and location data seldom change and are easily
        fetched from their own endpoints separately.
        </strong></p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>registration/?include=event,keywords</code></pre>
        <p><a href="?include=event,keywords" title="json">See the result</a></p>
