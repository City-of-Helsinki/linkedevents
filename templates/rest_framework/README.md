  * [ ] Any templates in this directory will override the generic Linked Events page templates. You may install the Helsinki specific template from the helevents directory by
`python manage.py install_templates helevents` and the Helsinki Linked Courses specific template from the helcourses directory by `python manage.py install_templates helcourses`.
Note that in order to get the helcourses template to function properly, `"helcourses"` is also needed in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
