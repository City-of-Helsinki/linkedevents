## YSO - General Finnish ontology **(Required)**

### What is it?

First, some terminology is in order. Starting with *ontology*:

> In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation,
> formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the
> concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many or all domains of discourse.
>
> From [Wikipedia of Ontology (information science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science))

YSO, short for *Yleinen suomalainen ontologia*, is basically a +30,000 collection of *
*concepts** in Finnish culture, translated in 3 languages.

> General Finnish Ontology YSO is a trilingual ontology consisting mainly of general
> concepts.
> YSO has been founded on the basis of concepts in Finnish cultural sphere.
>
> From https://finto.fi/yso/en/. You can browse the concepts there if you wish

Basic example would be, let's say a Portuguese language teacher coming to Helsinki to
teach Portuguese to children and also visit a sauna.

We might categorize it with "chldren", "education", "Portuguese", and "sauna"
*concepts*.

These *concepts* come from YSO.

### What depends on it?

Linked Events application has *events*. Events must be described by *concepts*.
Therefore, all events depend on YSO.

[add_helsinki_audience](#what-depends-on-it-5) also depends on this importer.

### How to use it?

Import all keywords in YSO into the database, without maintaining the existing
hierarchy between the concepts.

```bash
python manage.py event_import yso --keywords --all
```

This is scheduled to run `daily` on the instance as data doesn't change that often.

## tprek - Location registry **(Required)**

### What is it?

*tprek*, short for [ *Toimipisterekisteri*](https://hri.fi/data/fi/dataset/paakaupunkiseudun-palvelukartan-rest-rajapinta),
is a location registry service giving access to locations in Helsinki through a REST
API.

Basic example would be the location of a concert or a Kung Fu course in a certain sport
facility.

### What depends on it?

Linked Events application has *events*. Events must have locations.

By default, all event locations are from *tprek* location registry.

Therefore, all events depend on *tprek* locations to be present.

### How to use it?

Import all locations, which usually have addresses, coordinates and other metadata,
from *tprek* location registry into the database.

```bash
python manage.py event_import tprek --places
```

This is scheduled to run `hourly` on the instance as data changes often.

## osoite - Address registry

### What is it?

Let's get terminology in order.

`address` is a field in a `location` object. `location` can have other metadata.

[*P채채kaupunkiseudun osoiteluettelo*](https://hri.fi/data/dataset/seudullinen-osoiteluettelo)
is an address registry which only contains *addresses*. *osoite* is a Metropolitan
*location* list importer, which creates a *location* object with only one field of
*address* from the addresses imported from *P채채kaupunkiseudun osoiteluettelo*.

Basic example would be the location of a one-off random event in a private location.
Locations not meant to be used regularly are not usually added to *tprek*.

### What depends on it?

If you want to give the users of your application the ability to add events with
locations which are not present in *tprek*, you need *osoite*.

In other words, *osoite* is fall-back for *tprek*.

### How to use it?

Create locations from *osoite* address registry into the database.

```bash
python manage.py event_import osoite --places
```

This is scheduled to run `daily` on the instance as origin database updates daily too.

## espoo - Espoo city

### What is it?

*espoo* is an importer for Espoo city *Events* from https://espoo.fi.

Basic example would be an event organized by Espoo city for its residents, which you can
import with this importer.

### What depends on it?

If you want to populate the database with events organized by Espoo city, you need
*espoo* importer.

### How to use it?

Import all events organized by Espoo city into the database.

```bash
python manage.py event_import espoo --events
```

This is scheduled to run `hourly` on the instance as data changes often.

## add_helsinki_audience

### What is it?

*add_helsinki_audience* is a django management command for creating a set of *audience*
keywords in the database which is then exposed through `/keyword_set` endpoint.

Basic example would be an event whose target audience are elderly immigrants.

"Elderly" and "Immigrant" are keywords that the event creator would pick from the
choices in the *audience* keywords set created by this command.

### What depends on it?

Any YSO keyword can be used as *audience* in the backend. However, if you're running
the [Linked Events UI](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents-ui),
you need this command as the UI only allows the keywords set with this command to be
used.

You are free to make your own UI that uses any YSO concept for the target *audience* and
you can skip this command.

Keywords in this set are all from YSO except the ones defined
in `NEW_SOTE_KEYWORDS_DATA`
in [add_helsinki_audience.py](./events/management/commands/add_helsinki_audience.py).
Concepts defined in `NEW_SOTE_KEYWORDS_DATA` were not found in YSO, and therefore were
hard-coded manually.

### How to use it?

Create a Helsinki audience keywords set into the database.

```bash
python manage.py add_helsinki_audience
```

## add_helsinki_topics

### What is it?

*add_helsinki_topics* is a django management command for creating a set of *topics*
keywords in the database which is then exposed through `/keyword_set` endpoint.

Basic example would be an event in which they would talk about welfare.

"Discussion" and "Welfare" are keywords that the event creator would pick from the
choices in the *topics* keywords set created by this command.

### What depends on it?

All the topics used by this command are existing YSO concepts, hand-picked
in [add_helsinki_topics.py](./events/management/commands/add_helsinki_topics.py).

If you're running
the [Linked Events UI](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents-ui),
you need this command as the UI needs to show a list of event *topics* keywords for the
event creator to choose for the event they would like to create.

### How to use it?

Create a Helsinki topic keywords set into the database.

```bash
python manage.py add_helsinki_topics
```

## import_organizations

### What is it?

*import_organizations* is an importer for importing all City of Helsinki organization
**divisions** while maintaining their **hierarchy** into the database.

Basic example would be, say City of Helsinki has A, B, and C divisions, and A and B have
two sub-divisions themselves.

This importer would import all 5 divisions while maintaining the hierarchy within the
divisions.

### What depends on it?

If you're having an application whose target users are City of Helsinki organization
employees, you need this importer.

Then, you can assign required permissions to users in django-admin based on which
division they belong to.

### How to use it?

Import all City of Helsinki organization divisions into the database while maintaining
their hierarchy.

```bash
python manage.py import_organizations https://dev.hel.fi/paatokset/v1/organization/?limit=1000 -c openahjo -s OpenAhjoAPI:ahjo
```

## install_templates

### What is it?

*install_templates* is a django management command for giving the browsable API which
comes from django-rest-framework a Helsinki brand look and feel and also instructions
for the API user.

Basic example would be the live version
of [Linked Events API for Helsinki city](https://api.hel.fi/linkedevents/v1/event/)
which is blue and also includes instructions on how to query the API when you'd like to
apply certain filters to the `/event` endpoint.

### What depends on it?

If you're having an application for Helsinki city and you'd like the browsable API to
have Helsinki brand look and feel and also instructions for API user, you need this
django management command.

### How to use it?

Install Helsinki city templates for the browsable API.

```bash
python manage.py install_templates helevents
```

## geo_import

### What is it?

*geo_import* is an importer which creates *divisions* data structure for each *place*
object in database.

For example, a simplified *place* object from Sello library can be like so:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "tprek:15417",
  "position": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
      24.80992,
      60.21748
    ]
  },
  "name": {
    "fi": "Sellon kirjasto",
    "sv": "Sellobiblioteket",
    "en": "Sellon kirjasto"
  },
  ...
},
```

And by running this importer, you'd add `divisions` to the object above:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "tprek:15417",
  "divisions": [
    {
      "type": "muni",
      "ocd_id": "ocd-division/country:fi/kunta:espoo",
      "municipality": null,
      "name": {
        "fi": "Espoo",
        "sv": "Esbo"
      }
    }
  ],
  "position": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
      24.80992,
      60.21748
    ]
  },
  "name": {
    "fi": "Sellon kirjasto",
    "sv": "Sellobiblioteket",
    "en": "Sellon kirjasto"
  },
  ...
},
```

This allows the API user to query the `/place` endpoint by adding division of Espoo as
an example:

```
/place/?division=Espoo
```

Or directly querying the `/event` endpoint by filtering division of Espoo as an example:

```
/event/?division=Espoo
```

### What depends on it?

If you'd like to add support for division based filtering of events or places in your
application, then you need this importer.

### How to use it?

Import all municipalities in Finland from https://kartat.kapsi.fi/.

```bash
python manage.py geo_import finland --municipalities
```

Import all divisions in Helsinki from
the [Helsinki district division datasets](https://hri.fi/data/dataset/helsingin-piirijako).
This allows more specific filtering for Helsinki city based on `district` names,
`sub_district` names, and `neighborhood` names.

```bash
python manage.py geo_import helsinki --divisions
```

## kulke

### What is it?

*kulke*, short for *Kulttuurikeskukset*, is an importer which imports *events* and
*courses* from City of Helsinki cultural
centers (http://annantalo.fi, http://vuotalo.fi, http://malmitalo.fi etc.).

**NOTE**: To get access to data from City of Helsinki cultural centers, you need to have
access to City of Helsinki internal network. Specifics of how to get this access for
City of Helsinki developers will be documented here later.

### What depends on it?

If you'd like to have events and courses organized by City of Helsinki cultural centers
in your Linked Events application instance, you need this importer.

### How to use it?

Import all events organized by City of Helsinki cultural centers.

```bash
python manage.py event_import kulke --events
```

Import all courses organized by City of Helsinki cultural centers.

```bash
python manage.py event_import kulke --courses
```

These are scheduled to run `hourly` on the instance as data changes often.

## lippupiste

### What is it?

*lippupiste* is an importer which imports *events* from Lippupiste
Oy (https://lippu.fi); currently used only for
importing [Helsinki City Theater](https://hkt.fi/) events.

**NOTE**: To get access to data from Lippupiste, you need to have an agreement with
Lippupiste Oy. The data is not publicly available at the moment.

### What depends on it?

If you'd like to have events marketed by Lippupiste anywhere in Finland in your Linked
Events application instance, you need this importer.

### How to use it?

Import events marketed by Lippupiste Oy into the database. Currently, the importer only
imports plays by the Helsinki City Theater; the imported locations and events can be
filtered in the importer code.

```bash
python manage.py event_import lippupiste --events
```

This is scheduled to run `hourly` on the instance as data changes often.

## enkora

### What is it?

*Enkora* is an importer which imports *courses*
from [Enkora](https://enkora.fi/fi/referenssit/helsingin-liikuntavirasto/)
ERP used by Sports and Leisure.

Enkora acts as a data provider for other systems, like LinkedEvents with information on
activities and courses.

### What depends on it?

Activities from Enkora are published on number of websites and applications by City of
Helsinki.

This importer is merely a bridge to transmit and transform activity data to
LinkedEvents.

### How to use it?

Dependencies:

* Credentials into Enkora API
* YSO keywords imported to SQL
* TPrek places imported to SQL

Import Enkora courses with a single command:

```bash
python manage.py event_import enkora --courses
```

Running this imports all active courses from ERP into the database.

### Mapping

* Enkora location is mapped to TPrek place
* Enkora keyword is mapped to audience keywords
* Enkora description is mapped to keywords and audience keywords

A MarkDown-document how mapping works can be auto-generated.
