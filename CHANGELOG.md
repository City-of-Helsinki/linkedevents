# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. If possible, each change should also include a
short reasoning for why the change was introduced.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

<!-- List the changes in your PR under the Unreleased title. You can also copy this list to your PR summary. -->

## [1.3.0] - 2020-12-08

### Added

- A new Django management command `add_espoo_audience` for adding a new keyword set `espoo:audiences` with Espoo's
  target audience keywords. The management command also adds a new custom Espoo audience keyword `espoo:a1` (seniorit)
  to all events that have the `yso:p2433` (ik채채ntyneet) YSO keyword. The custom Espoo audience keyword has been added
  because Espoo wants to use the term `seniorit` instead of the term `ik채채ntyneet` since `seniorit` is the established
  term that Espoo is using in Espoo.fi. Instead of renaming the YSO keyword or implementing the mapping directly in the
  importers, the mapping is now done in this management command in order to better isolate the change and thus minimize
  changes to existing functionality for keeping the repository compatible with the upstream `linkedevents` repository.
  Since the mapping needs to be done to newly imported events, it's recommended to run this management command hourly
  since some of the importers should also be run hourly.

### Changed

- The `yso` importer's `KEYWORDS_TO_ADD_TO_AUDIENCE` list to only include the YSO keywords that the `espoo:audiences`
  keyword set contains so that only the audience keywords that are relevant to Espoo are added to an event's audience
  list in event imports. Note that this doesn't affect just the `yso` importer since other importers use the
  `KEYWORDS_TO_ADD_TO_AUDIENCE` list although it's defined in the `yso` importer.
- Replaced the `add_helsinki_audience` example command in `Makefile` with the new `add_espoo_audience` command

## [1.2.1] - 2020-12-08

### Fixed

- The dependency resolution issue on the CI caused by incompatible versions of the `click` dependency. Currently,
  `click` is locked to version `7.1.2` in `requirements-dev.txt` but `gitlint` version `0.12.0` requires version `7.0`
  of `click`. However, `gitlint` version `0.15.0` requires version `7.1.2` of `click` which is the same as the locked
  version in `requirements-dev.txt`. So, upgrading `gitlint` fixes the dependency resolution error.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-12-03

### Added

- Versioning for `espooevents-service` based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) so that it's easier to
  understand what type of changes each release contain and to better communicate breaking changes
- Instructions for versioning and a rationale for why versioning is useful
- Scripts for validating the version number and pushing the version tag to GitHub
- CircleCI configuration for automatically pushing the version tag to GitHub when a change has been merged to `master`
- A changelog to better document what's changed and why so that future development and maintenance would hopefully be
  a bit easier
- Changelog entries to all previous releases to better document the changes and their rationale for future developers
- Checklist item to the GitHub pull request template for ensuring that the changelog has been updated and the version
  number incremented for each release

## [1.1.1] - 2020-11-18

### Fixed

- The `lint` task in `Makefile` by adding the missing environment variable which is required by the Docker entrypoint
  script although it isn't actually required by the `lint` command
- The importer tasks in `Makefile` by adding the missing environment variable for specifying the data source. It's
  better to set it explicitly since some of the importers use the `SYSTEM_DATA_SOURCE_ID` setting and if it isn't set,
  the application uses the default value of `system` which isn't very descriptive.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-11-16

This release syncs the latest changes from [linkedevents](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents)
([commits ead9059...76d10d2](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/compare/ead90596e421a6c996fcc88c47b17e8011ce5013...76d10d2aae0cef430ea7cae77919cf5c8122c757))

- The external link creation in the base importer ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents#429](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/pull/429))
- The Docker image build error by installing `build-essential` which is needed because `python-Levenshtein` seems to
  require `gcc`

  required by one of the Linked Events changes. The `pg_trgm` extension can't be installed using an application database
  migration since we haven't granted the migration user rights to create extensions.
  - **NOTE!** Since the init script is only run once when setting up the database, we need to install the extension
    manually for any databases that have already been initialized

## [0.18.0] - 2020-04-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The Git hook installation script to create symlinks to the Git hook files instead of copying them. This
  way, the hook files don't have to be copied again if any of the hook files change. For this to take effect, it
  requires that the currently installed Git hooks are removed from the `.git/hooks` directory and that the Git hook
  installation script is rerun.

### Fixed

- The issue with `truffleHog`'s `--since_commit` option (see https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog/issues/108) by
  instead searching for secrets only in the current feature branch's commits by using the `--branch` and `--max_depth`
  options

## [0.17.0] - 2020-03-30

### Added

- Example commands to `Makefile` for running the `update_n_events` management command for keywords and places locally

## [0.16.0] - 2020-03-27

### Added

- Example commands to `Makefile` for building the development Docker image and for running tests locally

### Changed

- The layer order in the distribution Docker image for better cache reuse. For instance, the build and commit args
  passed to the Docker image change frequently causing the Docker layer cache to be invalidated and all later layers to
  be rebuilt. Thus, it's better to move the build and commit args as down as possible in the Dockerfile. By optimizing
  cache reuse by better layer ordering, we can, e.g., speed up the CI workflows and save storage space.
- Removed all files that aren't copied to the distribution Docker image from the `.dockerignore` whitelist since these
  files are unnecessary
- Refactored the development Docker image so that it can be used for running linting and tests on the CI instead of
  using the CircleCI Python image. This way we can utilize CircleCI's Docker Layer Caching feature and speed up the CI
  workflows.
- The `lint` example command in `Makefile` to work with the development Docker image
- The CircleCI configuration and scripts to run tests on CircleCI with the development Docker image. This way we can
  speed up the workflow by using CircleCI's Docker Layer Caching feature.
- The distribution Docker image to define the Docker labels only once since CircleCI's Docker daemon doesn't support
  `BuildKit` whereby there's no way to skip stages in multi-stage builds. Therefore, when building the admin image, it
  also builds the dist image. This in turn caused the label statements to be run twice.

## [0.15.1] - 2020-03-27

### Fixed

- Two tests that failed due to datetime calculations that differ from the actual implementation. The calculations in the
  tests don't take daylight saving time correctly into account. This fixes the issue by calculating the expected
  `end_time` in the tests in the same way as the implementation calculates the automatic `end_time`.

- To allow canceling of incomplete events, e.g., external events that have missing data ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@bd3f709](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/bd3f70902e2b348ea3c786620811dd3e0d6ae0a9))
- Upgraded [Django](https://github.com/django/django) to version `2.2.11` ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@b72780a](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/b72780a51a167f799275d794e06ea66e4d4520e2))

### Fixed

- Bug preventing bulk editing of events from other data sources ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@4e8df37](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/4e8df3732cfc5e5f62c6a14727a78d16f96c191f),
  [City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@8607ee5](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/8607ee5d327e593addcc19a6f0d63d77436f2a99),
  [City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@71f55dc](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/71f55dc3b056408c2726c60b37011569449a246d))

### Security

- Upgraded the insecure version of [bleach](https://github.com/mozilla/bleach) to version `3.1.1` ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents#392](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/pull/392))
- Upgraded the insecure version of [bleach](https://github.com/mozilla/bleach) to version `3.1.2` ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents#399](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/pull/399))

## [0.14.1] - 2020-03-26

### Fixed

- The CircleCI Jira orb rate limit issues with downloading `jq` by caching `jq` so that it doesn't have to be
  downloaded again in each CircleCI job

## [0.14.0] - 2020-03-19

### Changed

- Upgraded the `builder-aws` Docker image used by CircleCI to the latest version which has Terraform `0.12.23`
  installed. This needs to be done in order for the deployments to continue working since `espooevents-infra`
  was upgraded to use Terraform `0.12` and the deployments would fail if trying to run them with Terraform `0.11`.

## [0.13.1] - 2020-03-12

### Fixed

- The app throwing an exception when the `Mailgun` settings haven't been configured by accepting a new environment
  variable `ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS` which is used to define whether the notification feature is enabled or not. This way,
  if `Mailgun` and the email settings haven't been configured, the notification feature can be disabled thus preventing
  the app from crashing when trying to send notifications.

## [0.13.0] - 2020-03-11

This release syncs the latest changes from [linkedevents](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents)

### Changed

- The Helsinki-specific Travis configuration to run `flake8` and `pytest` also for the `helevents` app

- The notification feature to not send "Event published" and "Event deleted" notifications to the last modifier of an
  event and to only send "Event deleted" notifications for draft events ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents#395](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/pull/395))
- The event API to check for `NUL` strings in all query parameters ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@b3c7fbb](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/b3c7fbb2627c0ba1e565c3559489d14976c89bd5))

### Security

- Upgraded the insecure version of [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) to version `7.0.0` ([City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@7c4716e](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/7c4716e7fe2c561b889ab55feef0c2e67d2e16ee))

## [0.12.1] - 2020-03-11

### Fixed

- The issue with the `espooevents-service` admin site not working correctly when multiple instances are deployed. The
  issue was caused by `linkedevents/settings.py` not reading the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable causing the app to
  always generate a file-based secret key. This, in turn, caused each deployed instance to have different local secret
  keys whereby they couldn't access each others sessions since they used different secrets. Because of this an admin
  user randomly appeared to be logged out from the admin site depending on which instance received the request. This was
  fixed by making `linkedevents/settings.py` read the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable so that each instance uses the
  same secret for the admin site sessions.

## [0.12.0] - 2020-03-10

### Added

- Support for running `espooevents-service` behind a proxy so that the hostnames, e.g., in the links in the browsable
  API are shown correctly. This is achieved by accepting the following environment variables which control the behaviour
  of the app when running it behind a proxy:
  - [SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secure-proxy-ssl-header) which should
    be set to `('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')` when running the app behind a proxy which terminates the TLS
    connection
  - [USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#use-x-forwarded-host) which should be set
    to `True` when running the app behind a proxy
- A custom Django middleware to replace the `X-Forwarded-{Port|Proto}` header values based on the values specified in
  the headers defined by the following environment variables:
  - `CUSTOM_X_FORWARDED_PORT_HEADER` for specifying the custom header which should be used to override the
    `X-FORWARDED-PORT` header value
  - `CUSTOM_X_FORWARDED_PROTO_HEADER` for specifying the custom header which should be used to override the
    `X-FORWARDED-PROTO` header value

  The middleware has been added to circumvent the issue with AWS load balancers overwriting the
  `X-Forwarded-{Port|Proto}` headers whereby setting them in a reverse proxy has no effect if the reverse proxy routes
  requests to the app via a load balancer. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/x-forwarded-headers.html).

## [0.11.0] - 2020-03-06

### Added

- [django-redis](https://github.com/jazzband/django-redis) for configuring Redis for session storage in order to make
  `espooevents-service` stateless which enables the deployment of multiple `espooevents-service` instances for better
  fault tolerance. The Docker images now accept the following environment variables for configuring the session cache:
  - `CACHE_HOST` for configuring the Redis host
  - `CACHE_PASSWORD` for configuring the Redis password
- Docker Compose configuration for setting up a local Redis instance for local development
- Configuration for tests for using an in-memory cache for storing sessions in order to simplify the configuration
  needed for running tests

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Prefixed the database environment variables accepted by the different Docker entrypoint scripts with
  `DB_` so that it's easier to distinguish the DB environment variables from the Redis environment variables

## [0.10.0] - 2020-03-02

### Added

- Support for storing media files in AWS S3 using a [custom storage backend](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#overriding-the-default-storage-class)
  that accepts the following environment variables for configuring media file storage:
  - [AWS_MEDIA_DEFAULT_ACL](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)
  - [AWS_MEDIA_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#cloudfront)
  - [AWS_MEDIA_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)
  - [DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#default-file-storage) for specifying the
    the custom media storage backend class to be used

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Renamed the environment variables used for configuring static file storage so that it's easier to
  distinguish them from the corresponding media file storage environment variables. The new environment variables are
  the following:
  - [AWS_STATIC_DEFAULT_ACL](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)
  - [AWS_STATIC_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#cloudfront)
  - [AWS_STATIC_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)

## [0.9.0] - 2020-03-02

### Added

- [django-storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages) and [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) and
  configured them for storing static files in AWS S3 and changed `entrypoint.dist.sh` to run `collectstatic` for copying
  static files to the location specified by `settings.STATIC_ROOT`. The app now also accepts the following environment
  variables for configuring static file storage:
  - [AWS_DEFAULT_ACL](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)
  - [AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#cloudfront)
  - [AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)
  - [STATICFILES_STORAGE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#staticfiles-storage)
- Example commands to `Makefile` for importing Helsinki's audience and topic keywords and for creating a Django
  superuser
- A CircleCI `build` job for automatically installing the city-specific Linked Events templates for the browsable API as
  part of the CircleCI workflow
- CircleCI configuration for checking if a deployment succeeded and reverting to the previous deployment on failure.
  This makes deployments more robust by automating rollbacks on failure.
- Docker Layer Caching for the `test` and `dockerize` jobs on CircleCI to speed up Docker builds

### Changed

- Renamed `entrypoint.importer.sh` to `entrypoint.admin.sh` and also renamed `importer` to `admin` in other places using
  the importer Docker image since the importer Docker image is used also for other administrative tasks besides
  importing
- Refactored the CircleCI configuration to split the distribution and importer dockerizations to their own jobs for
  being able to run the jobs in parallel and thus speeding up the CircleCI workflow
- The CircleCI configuration to only target the `espooevents-service` ECS module on deployments with
  `terraform apply` since we don't want deployments to fail because of errors in the other ECS modules

## [0.8.0] - 2020-02-27

### Added

- A new multi-stage build stage to `Dockerfile.dist` for creating a separate Docker image for running the importers
  using AWS Batch jobs and a corresponding `entrypoint.importer.sh` entrypoint script for setting up the required
  environment variables and fetching the DB credentials from AWS SSM Parameter Store
- New build steps to the CircleCI `dockerize` job for building and uploading the importer Docker image to AWS ECR
- Example commands to `Makefile` for building the importer Docker image and for running some of the importers and
  management commands locally

### Changed

- The `EditorConfig` configuration to use tabs for Makefiles since Makefiles don't support spaces
- The `EditorConfig` configuration to use 4 spaces for Python files since that's an established convention and adheres
  to the official [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style guide for Python code
- The shell scripts to use an indentation of 2 spaces instead of 4 spaces
- Refactored the CircleCI configuration to use CircleCI's own structures for code reuse instead of using YAML aliases
  and anchors
- Refactored how the variables are passed to the `dockerize` job in the CircleCI configuration

### Fixed

- Added the missing `flake8` command to the `lint` task in the `Makefile`

## [0.7.0] - 2020-02-15

### Added

- CircleCI configuration for deploying to the dev, test, staging, and prod environments
- An `entrypoint.dist.sh` entrypoint script for the distribution Docker image to:
  - Inspect the Django project for common problems
  - Run DB migrations
  - Sync translation fields
  - Provide the required environment variables, such as DB configs, to run the app
  - Run the app with `Gunicorn`

### Changed

- Replaced the current database initialization scripts with more thorough database initialization scripts that are
  compatible with AWS RDS and also create the necessary users, roles, privileges, and databases in addition to
  installing the necessary DB extensions. In addition to the master DB user, two additional DB users are now created:
  - A DB migration user with less privileges than the master DB user but with enough privileges to run DB migrations
  - A DB application user with less privileges than the migration DB user but with enough privileges to be able to
    perform the DB operations needed to run the application

  It's also good to be aware that the PostgreSQL public schema has some [security concerns](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/A_Guide_to_CVE-2018-1058%3A_Protect_Your_Search_Path#Do_not_allow_users_to_create_new_objects_in_the_public_schema).
  Thus, the database initialization script now also revokes all privileges from the public schema.
- The CircleCI and Docker Compose configuration files and scripts to provide the necessary DB configs, such as users and
  passwords, in order to initialize the database successfully
- The `docker/django/docker-entrypoint.sh` script to check for required DB environment variables and provide them to the
  Django management commands
- The default DB master user credentials used in local development and when running tests
- Moved all scripts to the `bin` directory in order to clean up the project root
- Refactored code to remove as many references to `espooevents-service` as possible in order to keep the code general
  and compatible with the upstream `linkedevents` repository
- The distribution Docker image to use the official Python Docker image as the base image instead of the Voltti Ubuntu
  image in order to minimize dependencies to Voltti and to benefit from security updates to the official image. Also,
  made some changes to set up the timezones, locales, and a non-root user based on common Voltti practices.
- The example commands in the `Makefile` to provide the required arguments and environment variables for using the
  official Python image and for running the app using Docker
- Refactored the CircleCI configuration to use YAML aliases for CircleCI contexts

## [0.6.0] - 2020-01-30

### Added

- Instructions for manually generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in order to more easily test JWT authentication and the API
  if needed. This also documents the JWT structure expected by `espooevents-service`.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-01-28

### Added

- CircleCI configuration and scripts for linting and testing the code and for building and uploading the distribution
  Docker image to AWS ECR
- [CircleCI Slack orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack) to be able to notify of failed builds to
  Slack
- [CircleCI Jira orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/jira) for updating the CircleCI build status to
  Jira
- A separate settings file to be used when running tests. For now, the settings file only contains the test database
  URL.
- Git hooks for running the following tools:
  - [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting Python files and ensuring that a common coding style is
    used
  - [circleci](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli) CLI tool for validating the CircleCI config
  - [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) for linting the CircleCI config and other YAML files
  - [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) for preventing non-AWS credentials from being committed to the
    repo thus complementing `git-secrets`
- The `lint` example command to the Makefile for being able to easily run the `flake8` linter

### Removed

- The Helsinki-specific Travis configuration file since Espoo Events uses CircleCI for continuous integration and
  delivery

### Fixed

- `flake8` lint errors in `linkedevents/prod.py` by ignoring the errors since these errors aren't relevant when
  extending Django settings
- `yamllint` lint errors and warnings in the YAML files

## [0.4.0] - 2020-01-22

### Added

- [Gunicorn](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn) to the production dependencies so that we can use it to run the Django
  app in production inside a Docker container
- A separate placeholder settings file for the production environment
- Docker configuration for distributing and running the app in the other non-local environments, e.g., production
- A Makefile as a cheatsheet with examples for running and debugging different commands, e.g., Docker commands locally

### Changed

- The Django configs to not install the `django_extensions` app in production so that we don't need to install
  development dependencies in production

## [0.3.0] - 2020-01-20

### Added

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file for making sure that developers use consistent IDE settings
- Scripts to manage and install Git hooks for running the following tools:
  - [gitlint](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint) for checking that the commit messages adhere to the
    [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/)
  - [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) for preventing AWS credentials from being committed to the
    repo
- A health endpoint that can be used by load balancer health checks to see whether `espooevents-service` is running or
  not

### Changed

- Updated some of the instructions related to setting up the local development environment, e.g., installing the Git
  hooks

## [0.2.0] - 2020-01-16

### Added

- GitHub pull request template with a definition of done checklist for ensuring that the necessary steps have been done
  before merging and releasing the change
- GitHub code owners file for specifying the owners of the repository

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-10

### Added

- A fork of the [linkedevents](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents) repository starting from commit
  [City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents@907bbda](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/linkedevents/commit/907bbda9996be33011519bf4681f3ec974815698).
  The repository was forked so that we can apply the necessary changes to get `linkedevents` to run in the City of
  Espoo's Voltti environment according to Voltti's conventions. The purpose is to keep `espooevents-service` as close as
  possible to the original `linkedevents` so that it's compatible with the upstream which in turn makes it possible to
  cooperate and share changes between the repositories. Thus, any Espoo Events specific code should be avoided or kept
  to a minimum. This version marks the initial `0.1.0` relase and the initial `linkedevents` commit on which
  `espooevents-service` is based on.
